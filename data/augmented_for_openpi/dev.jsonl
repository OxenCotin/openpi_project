Avoid plonking one leg in the boat and leaving one on the jetty - this will cause wobbling and you might fall into the water. Once in the boat, always remain in the centre line to move around it and lower yourself to a crouch level so that you reduce your centre of gravity and keep the craft as still as possible. Now, what happens?",

    "question": "Prefer boarding across a solid platform if possible. If you are crossing using a platform, hold on to the rails provided. Avoid plonking one leg in the boat and leaving one on the jetty - this will cause wobbling and you might fall into the water. Once in the boat, always remain in the centre line to move around it and lower yourself to a crouch level so that you reduce your centre of gravity and keep the craft as still as possible. Keep the craft steady as others board. Now, what happens?",
    "answer": "location of other passengers were away from boat before and near boat afterwards, location of other person was on dock before and on boat afterwards, location of boat was docked before and in motion afterwards, motion of person was moving before and stationary afterwards, orientation of boat was perpendicular to dock before and parallel to shore afterwards, stability of boat was rocking before and steadied afterwards, state of passenger in boat was standing apart before and offering steadying hand afterwards",
